Single-pass SSA compiler and tiered register VM for sandboxed Python, with NaN-boxed values, inline caches, memoization, mark-sweep GC and snapshots. One WebAssembly module runs in browsers, JavaScript runtimes and the CLI.

## Edge Python

Python with classes, async/await, pattern matching and imports resolved at compile time. What it leaves out, for the sandbox or for the design of the engine, fails with an error instead of behaving differently. A program touches no file, network or environment unless `edge.json` declares a module that grants it.

```python
import json

async def greet(name):
    await sleep(0.1)
    return {"hello": name}

print(json.dumps(await greet("edge")))
```

## Running Edge Python

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you proceed, install the CLI on macOS, Linux or WSL.
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://cdn.edgepython.com/cli/install.sh | sh
> ```

First, declare the modules the program uses. `edge add json` writes them to `edge.json`.

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "json": "0.1.0"
  }
}
```

`edge lock` resolves that version into an `edge.lock` beside it.

Next, save the program above as `app.py`. Finally, run it.

```text
$ edge run app.py
{"hello": "edge"}
```

`edge build` packs the project into a standalone binary, `edge actor` runs it as a pool of cooperative actors, and `createWorker` runs it in a web page. Find out more in the [Quick start](https://edgepython.com/docs/get-started/quickstart).

## Repository

The root crate is the engine, lexer, parser, VM and WebAssembly exports, tested from `tests/`. `cli/` is the `edge` binary that runs `compiler.wasm` under wasmtime and the system calls in SpiderMonkey, and `js/` is the JavaScript host. `pdk/` and `abi/` are the kit for writing `.wasm` plugins, `fuzz/`, `bench/` and `skill/` hold the fuzzer, the benchmark and a guided reference for AI models, and `cdn/` stages and serves the CDN tree the host suites read. Build and test commands for every part live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## License

The engine is open source under the Apache 2.0 License. That covers `src/`, `tests/`, `abi/`, `pdk/`, `cli/`, `js/`, `fuzz/`, `bench/`, `skill/`, `cdn/` and `docs/`, so running it, embedding `compiler.wasm` and writing plugins for it need nothing from anyone. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
