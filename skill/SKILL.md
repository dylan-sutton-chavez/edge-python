# Edge Python

This document is self-verifying and its examples follow the cells v1 grammar. A `python` or `yml` block followed immediately by a `text` block is a runnable cell, and the `skill` crate beside it in the repository executes every cell through the edge CLI and compares it against the `text` block. The tag on the `text` block is `Output` for a run whose stdout must equal the block, or `Error` for a failing run whose stderr contains the given text. A `python` block tagged `skip` never runs on any engine and never pairs with a `text` block, and it always says why with one comment at the exact construct that is nondeterministic. A `yml` block tagged `actor` runs a trusted actor pool through `edge actor`, while one tagged `untrusted` runs eval groups. Any `python` block without a `text` pair is illustrative only. Every cell runs in a scratch directory holding this `edge.json`, since nothing resolves undeclared, and the `yml` cells find the same manifest beside their `actor.yml`. Verify the whole file from the repository root with `cargo run -p skill -- skill/SKILL.md`.

Edge Python is a sandboxed Python subset compiled in a single pass to bytecode and executed by a stack VM. It is one WebAssembly binary, hosted by the JS host, a JavaScript package built on the browser's sandbox model that runs in browsers and in JavaScript runtimes such as Deno, and by the `edge` CLI. There is no bundled stdlib, every module is an external package declared in `edge.json` and resolved at compile time, the official packages included. Programs are deterministic, there is no file, network or environment access unless a declared module grants it.

Use this skill to write correct Edge Python on the first try. The language looks like Python 3 but is a strict subset, and the differences matter more than the similarities. Read the delta section before writing non-trivial code.

## The working loop

A project is any folder with `.py` files and an `edge.json` declaring every module they import. The loop is always the same.

1. Write or edit the `.py` files.
2. Run the entry point with `edge run main.py`.
3. Add tests in `*_test.py` files and run `edge test`.
4. Pack a release with `edge build` when the program must run elsewhere.

```bash
edge init myapp        # scaffold main.py, an empty edge.json and index.html
cd myapp
edge add json          # declare each package the code imports
edge lock              # resolve every declared version into edge.lock
edge run main.py       # run the entry point
edge test              # discover and run every *_test.py
edge build             # pack a portable ./app.edge bundle
edge publish app.edge  # send it to the registry
```

Piping a script works too, which is how the cells of this document run.

```bash
echo 'print(6 * 7)' | edge run
```

When a file path is given, piped stdin instead feeds `input()`, one line per call.

## CLI reference

Bare `edge` prints help and exits 0. `edge -v` prints the version. `Ctrl+C` exits 130. Errors print to stderr and exit 1.

### Global flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--manifest <file>` | Use this manifest instead of `./edge.json` |

### edge run

`edge run [file]` executes a `.py` script, a packed `.edge` bundle or an app binary, auto-detected by content. With no file it reads the script from stdin. A bare `edge run` in a terminal with no pipe errors. `edge run -c 'print(1)'` runs inline code instead of a file or stdin, and piped stdin then feeds `input()`.

Run flags.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--events <f>` | Each line of the file or FIFO feeds one `receive()` call, EOF parks the script |
| `--save-state <f>` | When the script parks on an unservable wait, write a snapshot blob, print `state saved` to stderr and exit 0 |
| `--restore-state <f>` | Boot from a snapshot blob instead of a script and keep running |
| `--preempt <n>` | Yield every `n` loop back-edges so even a tight loop stays snapshottable, 0 disables |
| `--web` | Run on the browser host in headless Chrome, refusing the four flags above since they belong to the native engine |

`raise SystemExit(code)` with no argument or an integer exits cleanly with that code. Any other uncaught error prints a traceback and exits 1.

`--web` serves the JS host and the engine from the binary on a loopback port, so only the modules a manifest declares by URL leave the machine. It drives a Chrome the system already has, or one it offers to download once into `~/.local/share/edge/chromium`, which `edge uninstall` offers to remove. `EDGE_CHROME_PATH` names a browser directly and skips the search.

### edge repl

A persistent interpreter across prompts. Imports, definitions and mutations survive between lines, and an input that raises keeps the effects made before the error. One line is one eval, so compound statements go on a single line. Expression results are not auto-printed, use `print()`. Dot commands are `.reset` to wipe state and `.exit` to quit. History lives for the session only.

### edge test

`edge test [path]` discovers `*_test.py` recursively, skipping hidden dirs, `node_modules`, `target` and `dist`. A file argument runs exactly that file. Each file executes in a fresh interpreter and state never leaks between files. The project must declare `test`, otherwise the runner stops with `declare test in edge.json (edge add test)`. Exit code is 0 when everything passes, 1 when a file fails or no tests are found, 2 when the engine cannot start. See the test package section for the API.

`edge test --web` runs the same files on the browser host in headless Chrome, one browser for the suite with a fresh page per file, so a package can prove it answers the same in a browser.

### edge init, edge add, edge remove, edge lock

`edge init [name]` scaffolds `main.py`, an empty `edge.json` and `index.html`, with `--bare` skipping the HTML. `edge add json` looks each name up in the registry at its newest version, or at the one `json@0.1.0` names, writes one `imports` entry holding that version alone, and prints it with what the package asks the root to grant. `edge add foo=<url>` registers a custom URL verbatim, also under `imports`, since each host tells a `.py` and a `.wasm` module apart by the artifact, and a `.js` or `.mjs` URL is refused before anything is written. `edge add` keeps `extends` and any other key already there. `edge remove` deletes entries. Unknown names abort the whole command before any write, and neither command touches `edge.lock`. The same registry answers over HTTP, where `GET https://edgepython.com/api/search?q=<term>` finds a package and every address it names answers as data under `/api`, so `/package/<name>` reads at `/api/package/<name>` without taking it. A question in any language goes to `POST https://ask.edgepython.com` as `{"question": "..."}`, which answers out of these same pages and comes back as `{"text", "sources", "session"}`, where sending `session` back carries the conversation on.

`edge lock` turns each declared version into the URL and digest of that release and writes `edge.lock` beside the manifest, rebuilding the whole file each time. It is the only command that asks the registry where a name points, so `edge run`, `edge test` and `edge build` read the lock and resolve nothing themselves. A version with no entry, or one whose entry holds another release, fails with `'json' is not locked, run edge lock`. It also walks every package in the tree, each through its own `edge.lock`, and writes nothing while a package lacks what it lists from its importer, a check `edge run`, `edge test` and `edge build` repeat before compiling.

### edge serve

A static dev server with live reload for the current directory. `--host` defaults to `127.0.0.1`, `--port` to 5173, `--open` opens a browser.

### edge build

Three mutually exclusive modes.

| Mode | Default output | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| `edge build` | `app.edge` | Raw bundle for hosts and pools that already have `edge` |
| `edge build --app` | `app` | Standalone binary, runs offline on the same OS and CPU with nothing installed |
| `edge build --web` | `dist/` | Browser distribution with the vendored JS host and packages |

`--out <path>` overrides the default. The bundle contains every `.py` and `.wasm` under the project plus `edge.json`, the `README.md` and any `LICENSE` at the project root, together with each module the manifest declares by URL and the files it imports. When `edge.json` declares a `docs` directory, a `.edge` also carries its `.mdx` pages under a reserved `@docs/` prefix, checked against the rendering convention first, and an app binary leaves them out. The entry is `main.py`, `app.py` or `index.py` when present. An app binary accepts only the snapshot flags `--save-state`, `--restore-state`, `--preempt` and `--events`.

### edge publish

`edge publish app.edge` uploads a `.edge` packed by `edge build`, reading `EDGE_TOKEN` for a token made at `/settings#tokens`. The artifact is the whole request. The registry opens it and reads the `name`, the `version`, the description, the repository, the `LICENSE` and the pages under `@docs/` out of the bytes it is about to store, so nothing is declared twice and a listing shows what you shipped. A name is first come and permanent, a version is never overwritten, and the bundle is stored exactly as packed. One artifact is 10 MB at most, an account claims 10 names and publishes 60 versions a day, and its packages add up to 50 MB when it signs in by address alone or a gigabyte with GitHub or Google linked.

Where a package runs is not declared and not yet worked out, so a release carries no claim about its hosts.

### edge actor

`edge actor <file>` runs an actor pool from an `actor.yml` manifest, resolving group imports through the `edge.json` beside it or the one `--manifest` names. See the actors section for the schema and the two execution models.

### edge uninstall

Interactive removal of the binary and PATH entries.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `EDGE_COMPILER_WASM` | Path to `compiler.wasm` for the CLI build |
| `EDGE_CDN_BASE` | Serve the official CDN origin from another base for module downloads and `edge build --web`, used by tests and staging |

## The Python delta

Edge Python parses like Python 3 but deliberately drops parts of the language. This section is the one to internalize, because everything here is valid CPython that fails or behaves differently in Edge Python.

### Not supported at all

- No stdlib. Every module is an external package, so `import os`, `import sys` and `import asyncio` fail at compile time.
- No dynamic code. `exec`, `eval`, `compile` and `__import__` do not exist.
- No `open`. `input()` reads from a host fed buffer with no prompt argument.

```python
open("data.txt")
```

```text Error
NameError
```

- No complex numbers. `1j` lexes as `1` followed by the name `j`.
- No metaclasses, descriptors, `__slots__`, `__new__`, `__init_subclass__` or `__set_name__`. Some parse but are never dispatched.
- No `bytearray` and no `memoryview`.
- No exception chaining. `raise X from Y` evaluates `Y` but the cause is discarded.
- No `gen.send`, `gen.throw` or `gen.close`. Generators are one-way producers.

### Eager where Python is lazy

Generator expressions lower eagerly to lists. Write `def` plus `yield` when real laziness matters.

```python
g = (i * 2 for i in range(3))
print(g)
```

```text Output
[0, 2, 4]
```

`map`, `filter`, `zip`, `enumerate` and `reversed` return iterator objects whose items are all computed by the call itself, so the mapped function runs up front. `iter` over a list reads it live and over a `range` lazily, `next()` on any builtin iterator costs constant time. A builtin that takes an iterable, a `*` spread and an unpacking drain a user `__iter__` the same way, so an endless iterator runs until the budget stops it.

```python
seen = []
m = map(lambda v: seen.append(v) or v * 2, [1, 2, 3])
print(len(seen), next(m), list(m))
print(m)
```

```text Output
3 2 [4, 6]
<map object>
```

Dict views are concrete list snapshots taken at call time, not live views.

```python
d = {"a": 1}
keys = d.keys()
d["b"] = 2
print(keys)
```

```text Output
['a']
```

### Numbers are bounded

Integers are 48-bit inline with automatic promotion to 128-bit. Past ±2^127 the run raises `OverflowError`.

```python
print(2**126)
```

```text Output
85070591730234615865843651857942052864
```

```python
print(2**127)
```

```text Error
OverflowError
```

`pow(a, b, m)` requires a modulus below 2^63, and the `int_to_bytes` and `int_from_bytes` builtins cap at 8 bytes while the `int.to_bytes` and `int.from_bytes` methods do not.

### Reduced pattern matching

`match` supports literal patterns, captures, the `_` wildcard, OR patterns with `|`, guards with `if`, `as` captures, and sequence patterns like `[x, y]`, `(x, (y, z))`, `x, y` or `[first, *rest]` whose items nest any of these. Sequence patterns match only list and tuple subjects. Mapping patterns `{"k": v, **rest}` take literal keys, class patterns `Point(x, y=0)` read `__match_args__` and `int(n)` binds the subject, and `Color.RED` compares by value.

```python
def describe(value):
    match value:
        case 0 | 1:
            return "small"
        case [first, *rest]:
            return f"list of {len(rest) + 1}"
        case n if n < 0:
            return "negative"
        case _:
            return "other"

print(describe([10, 20, 30]))
```

```text Output
list of 3
```

`match` is a soft keyword. A parenthesized subject like `match (a, b):` works as a statement, and `match(a, b)` in expression position still parses as a call.

### Missing pieces by type

- `tuple` and `frozenset` have no methods at all. `(1, 2).count(1)` raises `AttributeError`, use operators or convert to list or set first.
- `str` lacks `translate`, `maketrans`, `format_map`, `isascii`, `isidentifier`, `isnumeric`, `isdecimal` and `isprintable`. `str.format` accepts positional fields only, no `{name}` keyword fields.
- `bytes.split` requires an explicit separator, `bytes.replace` has no count, and codecs are limited to `utf-8` and `ascii` with `strict`, `ignore` and `replace` error handling.
- `zip` has no `strict` flag. `round` uses ties-to-even and always returns int for one argument, float for two.

### Async without asyncio

There is no `asyncio` and no event loop object. The async primitives are top-level builtins, `run`, `gather`, `sleep`, `with_timeout`, `cancel`, `frame` and `receive`. There are no async comprehensions, no async dunders and no background tasks, `create_task` does not exist. See the async section.

### Compile time versus run time

Import failures and syntax errors are compile-time diagnostics and can never be caught with `try`. Everything else raises normal catchable exceptions at run time.

## Imports

Every import resolves at compile time through a host resolver. The compiler flattens each module into the bytecode and the VM fetches nothing at run time.

```python
import math
from json import dumps, loads
from math import sqrt as root
from re import *

print(root(16.0), loads(dumps({"ok": True}))["ok"])
```

```text Output
4.0 True
```

Dotted specs import files. A leading dot anchors at the importing file, one extra dot per directory up. Without it the spec anchors at the nearest `edge.json` dir. The `.py` suffix is implicit.

```python
from .lib.helpers import slugify
from ..shared.util import chunks
from lib.helpers import slugify as sl
```

Not supported. `from . import x` and any form of dynamic import.

Bare names resolve through `edge.json`, walking up from the importing file with the nearest manifest winning. The manifest maps each name to a path, a URL, or a `major.minor.patch` version naming a registry package under `imports`, and `extends` may name a parent manifest. A version resolves through the `edge.lock` beside the manifest that declared it, which every host reads before the compiler sees the manifest, so the compiler only ever meets a path or a URL. An `edge` field names the lowest engine the project runs on, `major.minor.patch`, and it runs on that version or any later one, never on an earlier one, which stops with `this project needs edge 0.7.0, this is 0.6.9`. The artifact decides the kind, `.py` is a code module and `.wasm` a native plugin, so a manifest never classifies a package, and a `.js` or `.mjs` import fails with `module 'charts' is JavaScript, ship a .py or a .wasm`, since no JavaScript loads besides the host's own system calls. `permissions` grants the system modules, see that section. `name`, `version`, `description`, `repository` and `docs` are the registry fields, ignored by the compiler and shape-checked by the CLI. Only what nothing else supplies belongs there, so an author and a date come from the publishing account and the license is read from the packed `LICENSE` file.

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "utils": "./lib/utils.py",
    "mypkg": "https://example.com/mypkg.wasm"
  }
}
```

The official names `json`, `re`, `math`, `struct` and `test` resolve only when declared, `edge add <name>` then `edge lock` writes each entry, and an undeclared name fails at compile time with `module '<name>' is not provided by this host and no edge.json declares it`, and the CLI adds a `help:` line with the `edge add` command for an official name. The CLI keeps the std packages inside the binary, so they need no network there. Modules are singletons with shared mutable state, an import cycle raises `RuntimeError` at startup, and inside an imported module `__name__` is its canonical spec so `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks are skipped on import. `import_module(name)` looks up a module already bound by a plain `import` in scope.

## Builtins

The global namespace holds exactly 68 builtin functions, the type objects, the exception classes, `NotImplemented`, `__name__` and the async primitives. Nothing else exists, and names like `dir`, `help` or `exit` are simply undefined.

### Output and input

`print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n')` accepts `file` and `flush` and ignores them. `input()` reads one host fed line with no prompt.

```python
print("a", "b", sep="-", end="!\n")
```

```text Output
a-b!
```

### Numeric

`abs`, `round`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `pow`, `divmod`, `bin`, `oct`, `hex`. `round` breaks ties to even. `min` and `max` accept variadic args or one iterable plus `key` and `default`.

```python
print(round(2.5), round(3.5), round(1.55, 1))
print(divmod(7, 2), max("xy", "abcde", key=len))
print(pow(2, 10, 100))
```

```text Output
2 4 1.6
(3, 1) abcde
24
```

### Conversion

`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `frozenset`, `dict`, `bytes`, `chr`, `ord`. `int` truncates toward zero and parses bases 2 to 36 or 0 for auto-detect. `int("nan")` style failures raise `ValueError` and `int(float("inf"))` raises `OverflowError`.

```python
print(int("ff", 16), int("0b101", 0), int(-3.7))
print(float("inf") > 1e308, ord("A"), chr(97))
```

```text Output
255 5 -3
True 65 a
```

### Iteration

`len`, `range`, `sorted`, `reversed`, `enumerate`, `zip`, `iter`, `next`, `map`, `filter`, `all`, `any`, `slice`. `range` is genuinely lazy, and the other iterators compute their items when created, see the delta section.

```python
print(list(enumerate("ab", start=1)))
print(list(zip([1, 2, 3], "ab")))
print(sorted([3, 1, 2], reverse=True), any([0, "", 3]))
```

```text Output
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]
[3, 2, 1] True
```

### Types and attributes

`type`, `object`, `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `callable`, `id`, `hash`, `repr`, `format`, `getattr`, `hasattr`, `setattr`, `delattr`, `vars`, `globals`, `locals`, `import_module`, `super`, `property`, `staticmethod`, `classmethod`. `isinstance` accepts a tuple of types and `bool` is a subclass of `int`. `x.__class__` is the same object as `type(x)`. `getattr`, `hasattr` and `setattr` behave like `obj.name`, properties and `__getattr__` included, and a `getattr` default answers only an `AttributeError`. `format(x, spec)` with a spec on a value that has no format of its own, a list or an instance without `__format__`, raises `TypeError`, and `f"{x!s:>10}"` pads its `str()`. `vars(x)` returns a snapshot of instance attributes, and `globals()` and `locals()` return copies whose mutation binds nothing.

```python
print(isinstance(True, int), callable(len))
print(format(255, "08x"), repr("it's"))
```

```text Output
True True
000000ff "it's"
```

### Bytes helpers

`bytes_fromhex`, `int_from_bytes(b, order)` and `int_to_bytes(n, length, order)` with a limit of 8 bytes and unsigned values.

```python
print(bytes_fromhex("ff00"), int_from_bytes(b"\x01\x00", "little"))
```

```text Output
b'\xff\x00' 1
```

### Exceptions

The catchable tree under `Exception` is `ArithmeticError` with `OverflowError` and `ZeroDivisionError`, `LookupError` with `IndexError` and `KeyError`, `RuntimeError` with `RecursionError` and `NotImplementedError`, `OSError`, also named `IOError`, with `PermissionError`, `ValueError` with `UnicodeError` and its `UnicodeEncodeError` and `UnicodeDecodeError`, `ImportError` with `ModuleNotFoundError`, plus `TypeError`, `AttributeError`, `NameError`, `StopIteration`, `StopAsyncIteration`, `AssertionError`, `MemoryError` and `TimeoutError`. Under `BaseException` sit `SystemExit` and `CancelledError`, which `except Exception` does not catch.

Handlers name one class, a tuple or nothing, and a bare `except` must come last. `except X as e` binds the exception and `e.args` is its argument tuple. `finally` runs on every exit path including `return`, `break` and `continue`.

```python
try:
    {}["missing"]
except (KeyError, IndexError) as e:
    print(type(e).__name__, e.args)
finally:
    print("always")
```

```text Output
KeyError ('missing',)
always
```

A class deriving from a builtin exception joins its tree, so `except ValueError` catches it. The constructor arguments become `e.args`, which `super().__init__(...)` or `Exception.__init__(self, ...)` resets, and `str(e)` follows `args` unless the class defines `__str__`.

```python
class Bad(ValueError):
    def __init__(self, code):
        super().__init__("bad code", code)
        self.code = code

try:
    raise Bad(7)
except ValueError as e:
    print(type(e).__name__, e.code, e.args)
```

```text Output
Bad 7 ('bad code', 7)
```

## Type methods

Methods live on the builtin types. `tuple`, `frozenset`, `bool` and `NoneType` have none. Read off the type, a method is unbound and takes its receiver first, so `str.lower("AB")` and `map(str.strip, lines)` work.

### str

`encode`, `upper`, `lower`, `strip`, `lstrip`, `rstrip`, `capitalize`, `title`, `casefold`, `swapcase`, `isdigit`, `isalpha`, `isalnum`, `isspace`, `isupper`, `islower`, `istitle`, `startswith`, `endswith`, `find`, `rfind`, `index`, `rindex`, `count`, `split`, `rsplit`, `join`, `replace`, `removeprefix`, `removesuffix`, `splitlines`, `partition`, `rpartition`, `center`, `ljust`, `rjust`, `zfill`, `expandtabs`, `format`. Indices count code points. `startswith` and `endswith` accept a tuple of prefixes. `format` takes positional fields with specs, never keyword fields.

```python
print(" hello ".strip(), "a,b,c".split(",", 1))
print("-".join(["x", "y"]), "Hello".casefold(), "{0}{1}{0}".format("a", "b"))
print("file.py".removesuffix(".py"), "5".zfill(3))
```

```text Output
hello ['a', 'b,c']
x-y hello aba
file 005
```

### list

`append`, `extend`, `insert`, `remove`, `pop`, `clear`, `copy`, `reverse`, `index`, `count`, `sort` with `key` and `reverse`. Slice assignment resizes, and `+=` extends in place.

```python
xs = ["bb", "a", "ccc"]
xs.sort(key=len)
xs[1:1] = ["z"]
print(xs, xs.pop())
```

```text Output
['a', 'z', 'bb'] ccc
```

### dict

Insertion ordered. `keys`, `values`, `items` return list snapshots, plus `get`, `update`, `pop`, `popitem`, `setdefault`, `fromkeys`, `copy`, `clear`. `popitem` removes the most recently inserted pair. Numerically equal keys collapse, so `1`, `1.0` and `True` are one key.

```python
d = dict.fromkeys(["a", "b"], 0)
d.update({"c": 1})
print(d.pop("a"), d.setdefault("d", 4), list(d))
print({1: "x", True: "y"})
```

```text Output
0 4 ['b', 'c', 'd']
{1: 'y'}
```

### set

`add`, `remove`, `discard`, `pop`, `clear`, `update`, `copy`, `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, `symmetric_difference`, `intersection_update`, `difference_update`, `symmetric_difference_update`, `issubset`, `issuperset`, `isdisjoint`. Named methods accept any iterable while the operators require sets on both sides. Iteration order is hash based, never rely on it and print through `sorted`.

```python
print(sorted({1, 2, 3} & {2, 3, 4}))
print({1, 2}.issubset({1, 2, 3}), {1}.isdisjoint({2}))
```

```text Output
[2, 3]
True True
```

### int and float

`int` has `bit_length`, `bit_count`, `to_bytes` and the classmethod `from_bytes`. `float` has `is_integer`.

```python
print((255).bit_length(), (5).bit_count(), (258).to_bytes(2).hex())
print((4.0).is_integer(), int.from_bytes(b"\x01\x02", "big"))
```

```text Output
8 2 0102
True 258
```

### bytes

`decode`, `encode` via str, `hex`, `fromhex`, `startswith`, `endswith`, `find`, `index`, `count`, `replace`, `split`, `lower`, `upper`, `strip`, `lstrip`, `rstrip`, `join`. Case methods are ASCII only.

```python
print(b"\x00\x01".hex(), b"a,b".split(b","), b"ABC".lower())
```

```text Output
0001 [b'a', b'b'] b'abc'
```

## Functions and classes

Functions support defaults, keyword arguments, `*args`, `**kwargs` and bare-`*` keyword-only parameters, plus call-site unpacking. The positional-only marker `/` parses but is not enforced, so never rely on it. Lambdas are single expressions. Decorators work on functions and classes, stacked bottom-up. Closures capture variables by reference, see the gotchas section.

```python
def greet(name, *, punct="!"):
    return f"hi {name}{punct}"

print(greet("edge", punct="?"))
```

```text Output
hi edge?

Classes support single and multiple inheritance with C3 linearization, zero-argument `super()`, `property` with setters, `staticmethod` and `classmethod`, and class decorators. There is no two-argument `super()` form. Dunders are looked up on the class, assigning one on an instance has no effect.

The supported dunders are `__init__`, `__call__`, `__repr__`, `__str__`, `__format__`, `__bool__`, `__len__`, `__hash__`, `__iter__`, `__next__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, `__contains__`, `__getattr__`, `__enter__`, `__exit__`, `__index__`, `__int__`, `__float__`, `__abs__`, the arithmetic and bitwise operators with their reflected and in-place forms including `@` through `__matmul__`, and the six comparisons. Returning `NotImplemented` from an arithmetic dunder triggers the reflected fallback.

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

class Scaled(Vector):
    pass

print(Scaled(1, 2) + Vector(10, 20))
```

```text Output
Vector(11, 22)
```

Context managers implement `__enter__` and `__exit__(exc_type, exc_value, traceback)` where the traceback argument is always `None`. A truthy `__exit__` suppresses the exception.

Pure functions are memoized automatically after two identical calls. The VM detects purity by the absence of I/O, mutation, raising and free-name reads, so naive recursive code is fast and side-effecting calls skip the cache safely.

## Async

The module body runs as an implicit coroutine, so top-level code can call suspending functions directly. A plain `def` called from a coroutine can also call them.

```python
async def dbl(n):
    await sleep(0)
    return n * 2

print(gather(dbl(1), dbl(2), dbl(3)))
```

```text Output
[2, 4, 6]
```

The primitives are builtins, no import needed.

| Builtin | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `run(*coros)` | Drives coroutines to completion, returns the first argument's result |
| `gather(*coros)` | Runs coroutines concurrently, returns the list of results in order, the first error re-raises |
| `sleep(s)` | Suspends for `s` seconds, `sleep(0)` yields once, negatives clamp to 0 |
| `with_timeout(s, coro)` | Runs the coroutine and raises `TimeoutError` when it overruns |
| `cancel(coro)` | Delivers `CancelledError` at the next tick, uncatchable, runs `finally` |
| `receive()` | Parks until a host event or actor message arrives |
| `send(group, body)` | Hands a string to an actor group, raises `RuntimeError` outside an actor pool |

```python
async def slow():
    await sleep(10)
    return "done"

try:
    with_timeout(0.01, slow())
except TimeoutError:
    print("timed out")
```

```text Output
timed out
```

Scheduling is cooperative. A tight loop without a suspending call cannot be cancelled or preempted unless the engine runs with `--preempt`. There is no `create_task` and no preemption between coroutines.

### Snapshots

The CLI can serialize the full interpreter state, heap, globals, suspended coroutines and scheduler, and restore it later. This is how long-running or event-driven programs survive process restarts.

```bash
edge run app.py --save-state state.bin     # writes the blob when the script parks
edge run --restore-state state.bin         # resumes from the blob
edge run app.py --preempt 500              # makes even while-True snapshottable
```

A snapshot is taken when the script parks on a wait the engine cannot serve, for example `receive()` with no events left. Without `--save-state` such a park is an error. The blob embeds a bytecode fingerprint and only restores into the same program, and a damaged or forged blob fails to restore instead of running. A restored run keeps the op budget it saved, capped by the limits it boots with. Feed a resumed run with `--events file`, one `receive()` line per call.

## Std packages

Five official packages, each declared with `edge add <name>` then `edge lock` and imported by bare name on both hosts. A version in `imports` names the release and the lock pins its bytes.

### json

`loads(s)` with optional `object_hook`, `object_pairs_hook`, `parse_float`, `parse_int` and `parse_constant`. `dumps(obj)` with `indent`, `sort_keys`, `ensure_ascii`, `check_circular`, `allow_nan`, `skipkeys`, `default`, `separators` and `cls`. Parse failures raise `ValueError`, non-serializable values raise `TypeError` unless `default` handles them. Integers round-trip at 128-bit and non-finite floats map to `NaN` and `Infinity`.

```python
import json

data = json.loads('{"n": 21, "xs": [1, 2]}')
print(json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True))
print(json.dumps({"bad": object()}, default=str))
```

```text Output
{"n": 21, "xs": [1, 2]}
{"bad": "<object instance>"}
```

### math

Constants `pi`, `e`, `tau`, `inf`, `nan`. Functions `sqrt`, `cbrt`, `exp`, `exp2`, `expm1`, `pow`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `log1p`, the trig and hyperbolic families, `atan2`, `hypot`, `dist`, `degrees`, `radians`, `erf`, `erfc`, `gamma`, `lgamma`, `fabs`, `fmod`, `remainder`, `copysign`, `ldexp`, `modf`, `frexp`, `floor`, `ceil`, `trunc`, `isnan`, `isinf`, `isfinite`, `isclose`, `fsum`, `prod`, and the integer functions `factorial`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `isqrt`, `comb`, `perm` at 128-bit. Domain errors raise `ValueError`, and a result too large for a float or a 128-bit int raises `OverflowError`. `nextafter`, `ulp` and `sumprod` are not supported.

```python
import math

print(math.gcd(12, 18), math.factorial(10), math.isqrt(17))
print(math.floor(math.pi), math.isfinite(math.inf))
```

```text Output
6 3628800 4
3 False
```

### re

`re` works as in Python, on a backtracking engine with a step budget that raises `RuntimeError` against catastrophic backtracking. `compile(pattern, flags)` returns a `Pattern` with the same methods as the module, the flags are `re.I`, `re.M` and `re.S`, and a bad pattern raises `re.error`, which is `ValueError`.

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `match`, `search`, `fullmatch` | A `Match` or `None` |
| `findall` | The text of every match, or its groups when the pattern has them |
| `finditer` | Each `Match` in turn |
| `sub`, `subn` | Substituted string, `\\1` and `\\g<name>` expand groups, `subn` also counts |
| `split` | The pieces between matches |
| `escape` | The text quoted to match as written |

A `Match` answers `group`, `groups`, `groupdict`, `span`, `start`, `end` and `m[n]`, and a group that took no part reads as `None`.

Supported syntax covers classes, anchors, quantifiers with lazy forms, capturing, non-capturing and named groups, backreferences, alternation, lookahead and fixed-width lookbehind, plus inline flags `(?i)`, `(?s)` and `(?m)`. Not supported, `\p{...}`, atomic groups, possessive quantifiers, conditionals, scoped flags and `bytes` patterns.

```python
import re

print(re.findall(r"\d+", "a1b22"))
print(re.sub(r"(\w+)@(\w+)", r"\2@\1", "user@host"))
print(re.search(r"(\d+)-(\d+)", "12-34").groups())
```

```text Output
['1', '22']
host@user
('12', '34')
```

### struct

`pack(fmt, *values)` returns `bytes`, `unpack(fmt, data)` returns a tuple, `calcsize(fmt)` returns an int, all with the codes and repeat counts of Python. A format with no prefix or `@` aligns each item the way C does, and `<`, `>`, `!` and `=` pick a byte order with standard sizes and no padding. A `Struct` keeps a format, with `unpack_from` and `iter_unpack`. A bad value raises `struct.error`, which is `ValueError`, and `pack_into` is not supported.

```python
import struct

buf = struct.pack("<hh", 258, -1)
print(buf.hex(), struct.unpack("<hh", buf), struct.calcsize("<hh"))
```

```text Output
0201ffff (258, -1) 4
```

### test

The test framework, imported by bare name and driven by `edge test` discovery. Test files do not need to call `run()` themselves, the runner evaluates the file and then invokes the driver, so a file that registers no tests fails.

- `@fixture` registers a factory under its function name, built fresh per test.
- `@test("description", *uses)` registers a test and injects named fixtures by keyword.
- `with raises(ExcType):` asserts the block raises, accepts a class or a tuple.
- Assertions are plain `assert`.
- `run()` executes everything registered, prints verdicts and raises `SystemExit(0)` or `SystemExit(1)`.

```python
from test import fixture, test, raises, run

@fixture
def numbers():
    return [1, 2, 3]

@test("sum adds up", "numbers")
def total(numbers):
    assert sum(numbers) == 6

@test("division by zero raises")
def div():
    with raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        1 / 0

run()
```

```text Output
pass. sum adds up
pass. division by zero raises
2 passed, 0 failed
```

## System modules

The project files, the network, the clock and the values a host keeps come from four system modules that ship inside Edge Python, `fs`, `net`, `time` and `secret`. They need no `imports` entry, only a grant from the root `edge.json`, and an import without one fails at compile time.

```python
import time
```

```text Error
'main' imports time, which edge.json does not grant it
```

`permissions` maps each holder to a list of `module:scope` entries. The holder is `main` for the code of the package itself, `all` for it and every package it imports, an import key for the package that key imports, or `eval` for the most a bundle may grant in an eval group. `net:<host>` allows exactly that host, a lowercase name or an IPv4 as `a.b.c.d` with no scheme or port and no IPv6, `net:<host>/<prefix>` bounds it to that path prefix and what sits under it however a server decodes the path, `time:wall`, `time:monotonic` and `time:zone` allow one clock call each, `secret:<NAME>` allows reading that one value, the name in uppercase letters, digits and underscores, and `fs:./<folder>` allows reading the project files under that folder, `fs:.` the whole project. An entry without a scope, like `"net"`, lets the package import the module and reach nothing.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "main": ["net:api.example.com", "time:wall"],
    "analytics": ["net:api.telemetry.com"]
  }
}
```

The root grants each package it imports under its import key. A dependency lists in its own `edge.json` what its code needs under `main` and what each of its imports needs under that key, and passes on only what it holds, so its importer has to give it all of that. `edge lock` stops until every package gets what it lists, and no import may be named `all`, `main` or `eval`. A package is what an import key brings in and the nearest `edge.json` above its files, the `name` it declares never counts, code it reaches by a relative import is its own, and a package two importers share loads once for each. Each call checks its scope again, a call outside the grant raises `PermissionError`, a subclass of `OSError`, and a request or socket belongs to the package that opened it. Every system module also takes `batch(calls)`, a list of `[name, *args]` lists answered in one crossing with the results in order, where the first failure raises. A `.wasm` plugin reaches the same calls through the `Sys` op of the ABI with the grants of its package, and finishes a call that waits in `__edge_resume`.

### time

`now()` returns nanoseconds since the epoch, `now('monotonic')` nanoseconds that never go back, and `zone()` the pair `[name, offset]`, the IANA zone and its offset in seconds. Without a `time` scope anywhere the engine runs on its virtual clock, so a `sleep` passes at once and in order and a host call takes no time.

```python
sleep(3600)
print("an hour, at once")
```

```text Output
an hour, at once
```

### net

`request(method, url, headers, body)` returns an id at once, `response(id)` waits for `[status, headers]`, and `read(id)` returns the next body chunk as `bytes` or `None` at the end. `connect(url)` opens a WebSocket whose messages come through `read`, `send(id, data)` writes to it and `close(id)` aborts either. Headers are `[name, value]` pairs or a dict and a body is `bytes`, a `str` or `None`. A failed connection raises `OSError` from the call that meets it, and in a browser CORS applies on top of the grant. A url names its host right after the scheme, with no user before it and no backslash, space or control character, else `ValueError`, while an `@` in the path stays. A non-ASCII host raises, pass its punycode. The path is resolved before the check and sent as resolved, so a `.` or `..` segment applies however it is spelled and text outside the unreserved set crosses as escaped UTF-8, and a fragment is dropped. No host follows a redirect, a 301, 302, 303, 307 or 308 raises `OSError` and the new address needs its own `request`. Headers fetch keeps for the host, like `Host`, `Cookie`, `Origin` or any `Sec-` or `Proxy-` one, raise `ValueError`.

```python
import net

r = net.request("GET", "https://api.example.com/items", [["accept", "application/json"]], None)
status, headers = net.response(r)
body = net.read(r)
```

The CLI and the browser run the same JavaScript for these calls, the browser in its Worker and the CLI in SpiderMonkey, so a program answers the same with and without `--web`.

### secret

`read(name)` returns the value the host keeps under that name as a `str`. A name the package does not hold raises `PermissionError`, and one it holds with no value kept raises `OSError`. The CLI reads `EDGE_SECRET_<name>` at the moment of the call and nothing else of its environment, with `--web` it hands the page only the granted values, and a page that embeds the engine passes them to `createWorker` as `secrets`.

```python
import secret

token = secret.read("GITHUB_TOKEN")
```

### fs

`read(path)` returns the text of a project file as a `str`, and `list(dir='.')` every file under a folder in order, both written from the root `edge.json` such as `shop/app/product.rb`. A path with `..`, a leading `/` or a name starting with a dot raises `PermissionError`, like one outside the granted folders, and a file that is missing, not UTF-8 or over 10 MB raises `OSError`. The CLI reads the disk or the bundle and never follows a link, and a page reads the files beside its program, listed in the `edge.files` that `edge build --web` writes and `edge serve` answers. Nothing writes.

```python
import fs

for path in fs.list("shop"):
    print(fs.read(path))
```

## Actors

`edge actor` runs many isolated programs as cooperative actors over a few threads, share-nothing with message passing. There are two execution models and the manifest chooses per group.

```yaml
runtime:
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:7777   # optional, its presence makes the actor a live server
  durable: tmp/actor/log         # WAL path, replays unprocessed messages on restart
  schedulers: auto               # or a fixed number
  max_actors: 1000000

groups:
  actor:
    run: app                     # script path or project directory
    replicas: 100                # ceiling, actors spawn on demand
    retry: 2                     # re-deliveries before a message is dropped dead
    seed: ["first message"]      # delivered before the pool starts
    out: stdout                  # stdout, null or file://path
    limits:                      # per-actor sandbox overrides
      memory: 64                 # MB
      preempt: 500
```

Each group picks exactly one of `run`, `code` or `eval: true`. Without `listen:` the pool runs until every message is processed and exits.

### The trusted model

Actors keep state between messages, pick work up with the `receive()` builtin and forward with the `send(group, body)` builtin, strings only, never blocking, and neither needs an import.

```yml actor
groups:
  actor:
    code: |
      msg = receive()
      print(f"got {msg}")
    replicas: 4
    seed: ["hello"]
```

```text Output
got hello
```

### The untrusted model

`eval: true` groups compile each message as its own program in a fresh wasm instance with its own memory, capped by the group's `memory` limit and by twice that plus 64 MiB of linear memory, and cut off after ten seconds of wall-clock time by a deadline the host enforces from outside. No state survives between messages. A bundle that carries its own `edge.json` resolves through it, any other message through the pool's manifest. Either way `.wasm` plugins are refused, remote modules load only from `https://cdn.edgepython.com/` and `send()` has no scheduler, so untrusted code cannot send or load modules from disk. A bundle grants its own permissions in its own `edge.json` as any root does, but only within what the pool grants `eval`, so an entry past it refuses the run before it compiles, and a snippet holds nothing. A `code` or `run` group is trusted instead, it keeps state, can send and can use `fs`, `net`, `time` and `secret` under the pool's grants, so reach for `eval` when the code is not yours.

```yml untrusted
groups:
  guest:
    eval: true
    seed: ["print(6 * 7)"]
```

```text Output
42
```

With `listen:` the actor accepts one `<group> <body>` line per TCP message and exposes an HTTP control endpoint, `GET /stats`, `POST /pub/<group>` and `POST /eval/<group>` for eval groups. Untrusted bundles arrive as base64 `.edge` payloads behind an `EDGEPKG:` marker and run from memory in a fresh instance.

## Semantics that surprise Python programmers

Closures capture loop variables by reference. Bind the value with a default argument when building functions in a loop.

```python
fns = [(lambda i=i: i) for i in range(3)]
print([f() for f in fns])
```

```text Output
[0, 1, 2]
```

Equal numbers and short strings are one object under `is`, a NaN aside. Reserve `is` for `None` and sentinels.

```python
a = 1000
b = 1000
print(a is b)
```

```text Output
True
```

List `+=` and set `|=`, `&=`, `^=`, `-=` mutate in place and aliases see the change. A user class gets `__iadd__` and the other in-place dunders first, then the binary operator. Every other augmented assignment rebinds.

```python
a = [1]
b = a
a += [2]
print(b)
```

```text Output
[1, 2]
```

Set iteration and repr order is hash based. Always present sets through `sorted`.

```python skip
s = {"a", "b", "c"}  # skip: set iteration order is hash based
print(s)
```

`id()` reuses heap slots and varies between runs. Never print it in examples or tests.

```python skip
print(id(object()))  # skip: heap slots are reused, the value changes between runs
```

Truthiness follows Python, the falsy set is `None`, `False`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `b""`, `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `set()`, `frozenset()` and `range(0)`. `bool` subclasses `int` so `True + True == 2`. `len` on strings counts code points. Same source and input give the same output on every run, `id()` aside.

## Sandbox limits

Programs run under a fixed budget. Exceeding one raises the matching exception, catchable except the op-limit `RuntimeError` whose handler re-raises on its first operation because the budget is still exhausted. Memory and operations can be raised, with `--memory <MB>` and `--ops <n>` on `edge run`, `edge test` and `edge repl`, `limits` on `createWorker` and `limits:` on an actor group. Memory counts 224 bytes per object, 8 per value a container holds and the bytes of each string, so a list of numbers is far cheaper than an object per row.

| Limit | Value | Raised |
|---|---|---|
| Call depth | 256 frames, fixed | `RecursionError` |
| Operations | 100 million | `RuntimeError` |
| Memory | 256 MB | `MemoryError` |
| Source size | 10 MiB | Compile error |
| Expression nesting | 200 | Compile error |
| Indentation depth | 100 | Compile error |
| Instructions per chunk | 65535 | Compile error |
| `repr` output | 1M chars | Truncated |
